# Hotel Rating Prediction
A machine learning project to predict hotel ratings based on customer reviews and other relevant features. This project combines natural language processing (NLP) techniques with regression and classification models to analyze textual and numerical data, delivering accurate and actionable predictions.



# Features
•	**Text Analysis:** Processes customer reviews to extract meaningful insights using NLP techniques like sentiment analysis and keyword extraction.

•	**Predictive Modeling:** Builds regression and classification models to predict hotel ratings.

•	**Feature Engineering:** Integrates textual, categorical, and numerical features for enhanced prediction accuracy.

•	**Data Visualization:** Provides interpretable charts and plots to explore trends and factors influencing ratings.

•	**Scalable Design:** Handles large datasets with diverse data formats efficiently.



# How It Works
**1.	Data Preprocessing:**
  o	Cleans and tokenizes textual data from customer reviews.
  o	Encodes categorical features and handles missing data.
**2.	Feature Engineering:**
  o	Extracts sentiment scores and other key features from text.
  o	Combines structured and unstructured data for modeling.
**3.	Model Training:**
  o	Uses regression models for predicting numerical ratings.
  o	Applies classification models for predicting categorical rating bands.
**4.	Evaluation:**
  o	Validates model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, precision, and recall.



# Installation
**1. Clone the repository:**

    git clone https://github.com/Malakismail/Hotel-Rating-Prediction.git
    cd Hotel-Rating-Prediction
**2. Install dependencies:**

    pip install -r requirements.txt



# Usage
**1. Prepare your dataset in CSV format with customer reviews and other features.**
**2. Preprocess the data:**

    python preprocess.py --data <path_to_dataset>
**3. Train the model:**

    python train_model.py --data <path_to_preprocessed_data>
**4. Predict ratings for new data:**

    python predict_ratings.py --input <path_to_new_data>
**5. Evaluate model performance:**

    python evaluate_model.py --data <path_to_test_data>
